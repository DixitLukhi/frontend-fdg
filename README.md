# Frontend - File Dependency Graph (FDG)

This project is a React-based FDG constructor designed to create, render, and interact with hierarchical file dependency graphs. The tool constructs dependencies between modules, folders, and files in a structured graph format. Developers can use this tool to understand and analyze project structures.

## Features

- **Dynamic Graph Generation:** Automatically generates a dependency graph based on the provided project structure.
- **Interactive Visualization:** Enables interaction with graph nodes and edges.
- **Zoom and Navigation:** Includes zoom-in, zoom-out, and reset functionality for easy navigation
- **Customizable Events:** Supports event handlers for user interactions such as node/edge clicks.
- **Hierarchical Structure:** Visualizes folders and files with distinct styles and properties for better clarity.

## File Structure

Below is an overview of the main files and their responsibilities:

**Components**
- **NavBar:** Handles user interactions and controls graph visualization.
- **GraphMenu:** Provides options for managing hidden nodes and graph-related settings.
- **ZoomSwitcher:** Enables zoom-in, zoom-out, and reset functionality.

**Hooks**
- **useZoom:** Manages zoom level states and their corresponding handlers.
- **useLevelGraphVisualization:** Visualizes graph levels dynamically.

**Visualizer**
- **event.js:** Initializes and manages event handlers for nodes, edges, and clusters.
- **generateDotSchema.js:**  Converts node data into DOT schema for graph rendering.
- **setupGraph.js:**  Configures graph properties and creates the initial graph structure.

**Utils**
- **graphProperties.js:**  Defines properties like shapes, colors, and styles for nodes and edges.
- **buildGraph.js:** Builds level-wise dependency graphs using data from dependencyGraph.json.
- **dependencyGraph.json:** Contains structured data defining nodes and their dependencies.


## Installation and Setup
Follow the steps below to set up and run the project:

## Step 1: Create the `assets` Folder
1. Navigate to the `src` folder of your project.
2. Create a new folder named `assets`.

## Step 2: Add `babel.config.json`
1. Create a file named `babel.config.json` in the root directory of the project.
2. Add the following content:

    ```json
    {
        "presets": [
            "@babel/preset-env",
            "@babel/preset-react",
            "@babel/preset-typescript"
        ],
        "plugins": [
            ["module-resolver", {
                "root": ["./src"],
                "extensions": [
                    ".native.js", ".native.jsx", ".native.ts", ".native.tsx",
                    ".web.js", ".web.jsx", ".web.ts", ".web.tsx",
                    ".android.js", ".android.jsx", ".android.ts", ".android.tsx",
                    ".ios.js", ".ios.jsx", ".ios.ts", ".ios.tsx",
                    ".js", ".jsx", ".ts", ".tsx"
                ]
            }],
            ["add-module-exports"]
        ]
    }
    ```

## Step 3: Add `bundler.config.json`
1. Create a file named `bundler.config.json` in the root directory of the project.
2. Add the following content:

    ```json
    {
        "rootModules": [
            {
                "name": "src"
            }
        ],
        "babelConfigFile": "./babel.config.json",
        "entry": "src/index.js"
    }
    ```

## Step 4: Install Required Dependencies
Run the following command to install the required Babel plugins:

```bash
npm i babel-plugin-module-resolver babel-plugin-add-module-exports
```

## Step 5: Clone the Repository
Clone the frontend-fdg repository into the node_modules directory of your project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DixitLukhi/frontend-fdg.git
```

Add dependency of frontend-fdg in the clone directory with 

```bash
npmÂ i
```

## Step 6: Add Script to `package.json`
1. Open the `package.json` file in the root directory of your project.
2. Add the following script to the `scripts` section:

    ```json
    "fdg": "node node_modules/frontend-fdg/bin/visualize-graph"
    ```

## Step 7: Run the Script
Run the script from the main project directory using the following command:

```bash
npm run fdg
```

You are now ready to use the `fdg` visualization tool in your project! If you encounter any issues, please double-check the configuration steps above.

## Steps to Use the FDG Constructor

1. Prepare Project Data:

- Structure your project according to the dependency requirements.
- Update the dependencyGraph.json file with your project nodes and dependencies.

2. Customize Graph Settings:

- Modify the bundler.config.json file to include root modules or update the Babel configuration.

3. Run the Application:

- Start the application to automatically generate and render the dependency graph.

4. Interact with the Graph:

- Click on nodes or edges to see their relationships.
- Use the GraphMenu to hide/unhide specific nodes.
- Adjust zoom levels using the ZoomSwitcher

## How It Works

1. Graph Setup:
- setupGraph.js initializes graph properties such as layout, colors, and styles.
- generateDotSchema.js translates node data into a DOT schema for rendering.

2. Rendering:
- App.js manages rendering the graph using Viz.js.
- SVG elements are appended dynamically to the DOM.

3. Event Handling:
- event.js initializes click, hover, and keyboard events for user interaction.
- Utility functions in utils/handlers.js process these events.
 
4. Dynamic Visualization:
- Graph levels and dependencies are visualized dynamically using useLevelGraphVisualization.
